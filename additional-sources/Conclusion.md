We have shown in this paper that we are trending towards a future where it becomes feasible to completely write all C/C++ code bases in Rust.
While this breakthrough sounds like it would lead to a utopia of bug-free code, there still may be some barriers break down before we get to this point in software's history.
In this scenario, it may be unwise to completely change decades old code bases for safety, if it comes at the price of maintainability.
In the current state of software development, most code is written by hand, and thus it would be extremely unwise to abandon this precedent to prefer a generated code base, even if it does result in more memory safe code. 
While the transition into a status quo that no longer produces unsafe code has been happening slowly, this may be by necessity. 
A quick adoption of any technology is bound to present unforeseen challenges that otherwise would have otherwise been worked out over a slower evolution. 



While it may be unfeasible to rewrite all of the memory unsafe software in existence, it is certainly possible to stop writing new unsafe software.
Rust is a perfect candidate to supplant the C family of languages in the future of software development.
This is shown through its safety features, speed,  interoperability with C code, and the current tooling that allows for transfer between languages. 
The transition into a Rust-dominated space should be executed with the same caution that adopting any new technology requires.
