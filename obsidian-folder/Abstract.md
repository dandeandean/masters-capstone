C and C++ have been dominant languages in the systems programming space since the 1970s. Both of these languages are immensely powerful, but this power comes at the cost of security. Memory security issues have plagued this style of programming since its inception. The tradeoff between speed and security is a false dichotomy, however. Rust is a programming language with the speed of C/C++ and the memory safety guarantees of a high-level language. The tradeoff that Rust makes is for complexity and speed of development. The problem we are presented with is the transfer from a C dominated space to a safer Rust dominated space. This paper will give a background on the security mechanisms of rust, the current state of automatic translation from C to Rust, and discuss what the future may entail for security minded individuals in the systems programming space.
